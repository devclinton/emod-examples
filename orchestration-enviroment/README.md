# Overview

This environment demostrates what is required to configure and run EMOD for a Malaria simulation on COMPS

# Detailed Explantation 

## Python Packages

* idmtools - These packages provide the orchestration functionality for emod and other models using the COMPS infracture. It also supports running models on SLURM. In the future it should also support just dumping out configurations for simulations. https://github.com/devclinton/emod-examples/blob/f7d38f62291d2631549014360474d38ccdc2cf4f/orchestration-enviroment/requirements.txt#L1-L4
* emodpy-malaria - This package provide configure utilities to make configuring our simulations easier. https://github.com/devclinton/emod-examples/blob/f7d38f62291d2631549014360474d38ccdc2cf4f/orchestration-enviroment/requirements.txt#L5
